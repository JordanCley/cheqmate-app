# cheqmate-app

Cheqmate is an ordering app that you can use from the comfort of your phone. Just sit down at your table, enter the table number and order away! This cuts out all the bulky hardware at your table as well as allows for a cleaner, safer visit at your local restaurant.

This is the UI for Cheqmate, built on React. I used Bootstrap for styling, with a mobile first approach.

## react.js, bootstrap, axios
